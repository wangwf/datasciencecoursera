Title
========================================================
In a population of interest, a sample of 9 men yielded a sample average brain volume of 1,100cc and a standard deviation of 30cc. What is a 95% Student's T confidence interval for the mean brain volume in this new population? Enter the lower and upper endpoints as two numbers with a space separating them. Give the numbers to the nearest cc.
```{r q1}
m<- 1100
s <- 30
n <- 9
error <- qnorm(0.975)*s/sqrt(n)
c(m-error, m+error)
```
